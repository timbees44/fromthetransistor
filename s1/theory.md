# Describe how FPGAs are buildable using transistors
## What is a transistor?
A transistor is an electrical componenet made up of semiconductor material (e.g. silicon). They are used as a switch or amplifier for electric signals. The most common type of transistor is BJT (bipolar junction transistor). They have 3 pins (CBE) the collector, base and emittor. As they are made semi conductive material, they are doped with other elements to create compounds that either have too many electrons to be shared (e.g. aluminium) or to create holes for electrons to fill (phosphorus). The excess of electrons creates a p-type semiconductor and the creation of holes creates a n-type semiconductor. NPN or PNP is the way in which transistors can be assembled.

## What is a FPGA?
A FPGA is a field programmable gate array. It is an integrated circuit (a set transistors and other electrical components on a flat piece of semiconductor material). Field programmable means that it can be customised after manufacturing for a number of different purposes. This is different to an ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) which is designed for a singular purpose.

## Building FPGAs using transistors
As FPGAs are integrated ciruits which are largely built up of transistors and other electrical components. The transistors are built into logic blocks (groups of logic gates, which are just transistors arrange in certain ways to allow for different combinations of electrical current flow). 

# ICs are collections of transistors in a nice reliable package
This point is mostly explained above. Simply; FPGAs can be built up of transistors, FPGAs are a type of IC therefore ICs are collections of tansistors in a nice reliable package. There are other electrical components such as diodes that can be present on ICs. A lot of these components share the same semi-conductor properties but with slight differences to serve different purposes.
